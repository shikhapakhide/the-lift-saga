# Those Eyes

She boarded the lift and shrunk within herself. She brought her hand bag closer to her chest as if it was some kind of shield. Drops of sweat were visible and she did not have any clue that people were staring at her. Who sweats when the temperature outside is 5 degrees. Any normal person will think of you as a weirdo. She wanted to scream " Stop looking at me. I have not come from asylum. I am just coming from my home and would like to reach the office and my home safely" She was checking the floor number continuously.Finally the lift hit the seventh floor , and out she rushed like a mad girl clutching her bags. She dumped the bags in her cubicle and proceeded towards the wash room. She went to one of the loo and relieved herself. She closed her eyes and sighed. The penetrating blood shot eyes were still staring at her. She got startled and got up from the commode. In this haste she spoiled her trousers. She flushed and came outside.She was almost in tears and started splashing water on her face furiously. After a while tears started tasting like the cold water.The incidents were morning were not sufficient to keep her on her toes , she felt the warmth of a hand on her shoulder.
"Are you ok Krittika?"
She turned with a start and splashed the person with some water.While Krittika was wiping the water from her face , she heard an angry voice " What the hell" This was a known voice.It was Riddhima's."I will kill you Krittika for this.I had to go to a meeting and see what you have done" Why are you giving me the dumb look? Can't you see what have you done?
Krittika took some time to come in a normal compusure and meekly said " Sorry yaar"
