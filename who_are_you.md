# Who are you

Krittika got ready for her office.Her wardrobe had latest designs , in vogue dresses , but these days she was picking up only grey and whites and that too plain trousers and shirts.Riddhima did poke at her that why suddenly she was promoting the plain jane look.Was this look in fashion ? She made a joke out of it.She used to board the bus , the transport provided by her office.In the bus , she had companions from different companies.Various organisations had started this initiative of bus-pool to reduce the carbon footprint.The bus ride was  one hour  to her office.It was not that she did not know how to drive but the journey used to give her time to finish her reading and spend some time meditating.She was staying with her parents and once she was back at home , she was not able to get her " me " time.Krittika was the life of her house and in the office as well.A girl who can talk non-stop when she is awake.But the recent incidents transformed her in an opposite character.Everybody around her was worried.Her parents were thinking that she was in a one-sided affair and Riddhima was thinking that she is pregnant.

It all started from last monday.She was waiting for her bus to come.She was looking casually around and then her gaze stopped at a person who was standing right opposite to her on the other side of the road.It seemed that he was staring at her.Krittika dismissed the thought initially thinking that it might be just by chance that their eyes met.She shifted her eyes from that person and was looking in the direction from where the bus comes.It was still five minutes to go for the bus arrival.She saw her bus friend coming and she waved at her.Krittika waved back and saw that person was standing next to her friend.Her friend was moving and crossing the road but that person was stuck to the place.The eyes were still looking at her.It was a cold Delhi winter and generally everybody is wrapped from toe to bottom.He was also covered in winter clothes and his face shrouded with a scarf.Krittika now gave him a hard look and checked him out from top to bottom.He looked like a guy of a strong built with big shoulders.His clothes bodyfitting him and the only visible part of his body were his eyes.It was starnge to see that the person didnt blink at  all.She was sure that this person is a male figure.
