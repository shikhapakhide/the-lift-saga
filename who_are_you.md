# Who are you

Krittika got ready for her office.Her wardrobe had latest designs , in vogue dresses , but these days she was picking up only grey and whites and that too plain trousers and shirts.Riddhima did poke at her that why suddenly she was promoting the plain jane look.Was this look in fashion ? She made a joke out of it.She used to board the bus , the transport provided by her office.In the bus , she had companions from different companies.Various organisations had started this initiative of bus-pool to reduce the carbon footprint.The bus ride was  one hour  to her office.It was not that she did not know how to drive but the journey used to give her time to finish her reading and spend some time meditating.
