> Picking the threads from my first book, [Define 36](www.bit.ly/define36) which was a collection of shortest ( flash) stories, my second work of Fiction, The Lift Saga, is a novelette.I have a long way to go before I will pen a full-fledged novel.Nevertheless, writing is meditation for me, and I have promised myself that I will never stop it.

***The Lift Saga represents that I have fulfilled the promise which I made with [Define 36](www.bit.ly/define36).***
