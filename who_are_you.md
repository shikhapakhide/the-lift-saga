# Who are you

Krittika got ready for her office.Her wardrobe had latest designs , in vogue dresses , but these days she was picking up only grey and whites and that too plain trousers and shirts.Riddhima did poke at her that why suddenly she was promoting the plain jane look.Was this look in fashion ? She made a joke out of it.She used to board the bus , the transport provided by her office.In the bus , she had companions from different companies.Various organisations had started this initiative of bus-pool to reduce the carbon footprint.The bus ride was  one hour  to her office.It was not that she did not know how to drive but the journey used to give her time to finish her reading and spend some time meditating.She was staying with her parents and once she was back at home , she was not able to get her " me " time.Krittika was the life of her house and in the office as well.A girl who can talk non-stop when she is awake.But the recent incidents transformed her in an opposite character.Everybody around her was worried.Her parents were thinking that she was in a one-sided affair and Riddhima was thinking that she is pregnant.

It all started from last monday.She was waiting for her bus to come.She was looking casually around and then her gaze stopped at a person who was standing right opposite to her on the other side of the road.
